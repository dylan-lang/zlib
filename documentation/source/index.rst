   zlib
   zlib-binding

This is the binding to the `Zlib <https://www.zlib.net/>`_ library
version ``1.3.1``.

The library is structured in two layers of modules:

* The module :doc:`zlib-binding` is the direct binding of the zlib
  library, making the C language functions and constants accessible to
  Open Dylan.

* The module :doc:`zlib` sits on top of :doc:`zlib-binding` and offers a
  more idiomatic access to the functionality.
